====================================
 MembraneCircle and MembraneHexagon
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Here's two supercollider externs.  They're rather similar, being
triangular waveguide meshes of a drum-like membrane.  You input some
excitation, such as a pulse of noise, and can adjust the tension and
loss while it plays.

They're named after the shape made out of triangular meshes.
Obviously you can't make a circle out of triangles, but it tries.  At
the moment MembraneCircle is a bit bigger than MembraneHexagon, using
more waveguides and therefore more CPU.

If you want to play with it you might want to fiddle with the defines
at the top of the .cpp files.

I'm linux based so I'm afraid can't offer help for how to get this
compiled for other systems.

 Files
-=-=-=-

Makefile - makefile tested for use under linux (ubuntu)

membrane.sc - code for testing with native supercollider (sclang)
membrane.lhs - code for testing with Rohan Drape's HSC library for Haskell

Membrane.cpp - The UGens are defined in here.

shape.c - Where the triangulation happens.  It would be quite trivial to
shape.h   add more shapes, patches welcome.

classes/MembraneHexagon.sc - class files for use with sclang, copy into
classes/MembraneCircle.sc    your Extensions folder.

triangulation.pde - processing patch for visualising the triangulations
